# AnchorPoint-AR
Unity-based AR system that scans real-world spatial meshes and anchors virtual objects to fixed positions using AR Foundation, ARKit/ARCore, and XR Toolkit, with support for persistent placement across sessions.

This project is a Unity-based Augmented Reality (AR) system that enables persistent placement of virtual objects in the real world by scanning spatial meshes and anchoring content using AR Foundation, ARKit/ARCore, and XR Interaction Toolkit.

##  Features

-  **Spatial Mesh Scanning:** Detects real-world surfaces using ARKit (iOS) or ARCore (Android).
-  **Anchored Object Placement:** Allows users to place virtual objects anchored to detected surfaces.
-  **Persistence Across Sessions:** Saves anchor data and reloads it in future sessions.
-  **Cross-Platform:** Works on both Android and iOS using Unity's AR Foundation.
-  **XR Toolkit Integration:** Uses XR Interaction Toolkit for intuitive interaction and input handling.

##  Tech Stack

- **Unity 2021+**
- **AR Foundation**
- **ARKit (iOS)** / **ARCore (Android)**
- **XR Interaction Toolkit**
- **C#**
